C-1.24 Write a short Python function that counts the number of vowels in a given
character string.
C-1.25 Write a short Python function that takes a string s, representing a sentence,
and returns a copy of the string with all punctuation removed. For example,
if given the string "Let s try, Mike.", this function would return
"Lets try Mike".
C-1.26 Write a short program that takes as input three integers, a, b, and c, from
the console and determines if they can be used in a correct arithmetic
formula (in the given order), like “a+b = c,” “a = b−c,” or “a ∗ b = c.”
C-1.27 In Section 1.8, we provided three different implementations of a generator
that computes factors of a given integer. The third of those implementations,
from page 41, was the most efficient, but we noted that it did not
yield the factors in increasing order. Modify the generator so that it reports
factors in increasing order, while maintaining its general performance advantages.
