# R-1.9 What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
# range with values 50, 60, 70, 80?
# R-1.10 What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
# range with values 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, −2, −4, −6, −8?
# R-1.11 Demonstrate how to use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
# the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256].
# R-1.12 Python’s random module includes a function choice(data) that returns a
# random element from a non-empty sequence. The random module includes
# a more basic function randrange, with parameterization similar to
# the built-in range function, that return a random choice from the given
# range. Using only the randrange function, implement your own version
# of the choice function.
